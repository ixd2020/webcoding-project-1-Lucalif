        <p>Catherine II[a] (born Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst; 2 May 1729 –
          17 November 1796[b]), most commonly known as Catherine the Great,[c]
          was Empress of Russia from 1762 until 1796—the country's longest-ruling female leader.
          She came to power following a coup d'état that overthrew
          her husband and second cousin, Peter III. Under her reign, Russia grew
          arger, its culture was revitalised, and it was recognized as one of
          the great powers worldwide.</p>

          <p>In her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine
            often relied on her noble favourites, most notably Count Grigory
            Orlov and Grigory Potemkin. Assisted by highly successful generals
            such as Alexander Suvorov and Pyotr Rumyantsev, and admirals such as
            Samuel Greig and Fyodor Ushakov, she governed at a time when the
             Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy.
             In the south, the Crimean Khanate was crushed following victories
             over the Bar confederation and Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish
              War, 1768-1774 due to the support of the United Kingdom, and Russia
              colonised the territories of Novorossiya along the coasts of the
              Black and Azov Seas. Catherine supported the United States in the
              American Revolutionary War, and as such Great Britain was not her
              ally in the next Russian-Turkish war. In the west, the Polish–Lithuanian C
              ommonwealth, ruled by Catherine's former lover, King Stanisław August
              Poniatowski, was eventually
              partitioned, with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share.
              In the east, Russia started to colonise Alaska,
              establishing Russian America.</p>

          <p>Catherine reformed the administration of Russian guberniyas
            (governorates), and many new cities and towns were founded on
            her orders. An admirer of Peter the Great, Catherine continued to
            modernize Russia along Western European lines. However, military
            conscription and the economy continued to depend on serfdom, and
            the increasing demands of the state and of private landowners
            intensified the exploitation of serf labour. This was one of the chief reasons behind rebellions, including the large-scale Pugachev Rebellion of Cossacks, nomads, peoples of Volga and peasants.</p>

          <p>The period of Catherine the Great's rule, the Catherinian Era,[1] is considered the Golden Age of Russia.[2] The Manifesto on Freedom of the Nobility, issued during the short reign of Peter III and confirmed by Catherine, freed Russian nobles from compulsory military or state service. Construction of many mansions of the nobility, in the classical style endorsed by the empress, changed the face of the country. She enthusiastically supported the ideals of the Enlightenment and is often included in the ranks of the enlightened despots.[3] As a patron of the arts, she presided over the age of the Russian Enlightenment, including the establishment of the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens, the first state-financed higher education institution for women in Europe.</p>
